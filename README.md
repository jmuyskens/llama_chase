I traced the approximate coordinates of the llamas in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwry-essLYg and recorded observations every five seconds.

# black_llama.json
The approximate coordinates of the black llama from 0:00 to 4:00

# white_llama.json
The approximate coordinates of the white llama https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwry-essLYg from 4:05 to 10:20
